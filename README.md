# CS350Final

•	Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

The problem that we were trying to solve with the final project was to take the code that was provided that wasn’t intently designed to be a thermostat and modify it in a way to show that we understand how to interface with an embedded system to achieve the goal of making it a thermostat.  While the device did have a temperature sensor, we had to add in drivers and implement and turn off certain features to ensure that the thermostat worked as we intended.  We had limited resources to work with, and the part of the project that was most crucial was to write efficient code that achieved our goals while utilizing as few resources as possible.

•	What did you do particularly well?

For the final project I documented my process quite well, and worked on implementing the code for the project in pieces so that I could troubleshoot as I went.  I also utilized my dry erase board to manage the development process.

•	Where could you improve?

I could improve in many areas of development of software for embedded systems.  I struggled in week two when it came to fully understanding state machines, and I have continued to struggle with understanding how to implement them quickly.  Building many different state machines would help me improve my understanding of how and when to implement a state machine into my projects.

•	What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?

I found many useful websites to reference when it comes to designing software for embedded systems.  I think the most useful was a forum for the specific board that we used for this project the CC3220SF.  I ran into a couple of environment problems during the second week of the course and utilizing this forum allowed me to correct and complete the class.  I have been a fan of reddit and stackoverflow for some time but have often avoided specific forums because they were too niche.  This class has helped open my eyes to more specific forums.

•	What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?

Time management is always a big skill that I learn more about each time I start a project like this one.  Managing your time and building a schedule and in the beginning of a development cycle giving yourself more time than you need.  Giving yourself time for things to go wrong is very important to the development process.  When things go wrong we have the capacity to learn the most.

•	How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

This project was made maintainable because it was well documented as to what each section of the code is being used for.  If someone was to come behind me and wanted to understand my methodology, they could.  My code was made readable by following the writing guidelines set forth in the earliest coding classes that I took at SNHU.  I provided block comments at the beginning of the program to give a brief introduction and in line comments to show what most lines of code were doing.  This code is adaptable because you can change the scenario or equipment and as long as the program is written in the same language it should be directly transferable.  If it isn’t directly transferable then the logic and flow control should be a solid starting point for someone doing something similar with a different system.
